# twitter-bot
The purpose of this program is to check if any articles were posted to the RSS feed today. If there has been, then it will automatically post the message defined. In my case, that is “Jeg har lige postet en ny artikel kaldet “title of post” den kan læses her: “link to post” #webudvikling #webdesign #multimediedesigner”

It was made with my personal Wordpress blog in mind, so it might not be portable to other blogs/rss feeds without some tweaking.
