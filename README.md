# twitter-bot
A simple Twitter bot made in Ruby.

The purpose of this program is to check if any articles were posted to the RSS feed within the last 2 hours. If there has been, then it will automatically tweet the message defined. In my case, that is “I just posted a new #{title_of_post} you can read it here: #{link_to_post} #webudvikling #webdesign #multimediedesigner”

It was made with my personal Wordpress blog in mind, so it might not be portable to other blogs/rss feeds without some tweaking. Furthermore, I am still pretty new to Ruby so it might not be best practices. Use with caution!
